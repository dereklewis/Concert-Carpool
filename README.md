# Concert-Carpool

## Application Purpose
We designed a website to help concert goers find a more efficient way to get to and from concerts. Concert Carpool provides an easy way to connect and meet up with like-minded people at your favorite artist’s shows, all while preventing the headache that concert goers will inevitably deal with.

## User Story
User Story: Going to concerts is great, but it’s a pain to coordinate getting to the venue. If everyone drives themselves, parking can be a nightmare and having to wait for Ubers takes too much time and money.

Solution: Concert Carpool helps concert goers find prospective rides or passengers to carpool together to the concert venue. This is a free alternative to find a ride to a venue and helps improve efficiency in going to/from the venue.

## Main Frameworks Used
